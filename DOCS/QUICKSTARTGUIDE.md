# _**SETTING UP YOUR BITAXE**_
## **NEW WITH INITIAL SETUP V2**
Starting with the introduction of Initial Setup V2, Setup has been simplified for new users. Advanced setup can still be completed in the "settings" tab, or in the AxeOS Web UI

# _**INTITIAL SETUP SCREEN**_
It only takes 3 Easy steps to start mining with the Bitaxe Touch:
1. Select Wifi
2. Enter Wifi Password
3. Enter BTC Payout Address

The below sections will help walk you through each step.

# **_SETUP NETWORK_**
## Network SSID

The Device will scan for local networks. The list of networks is scrollable, and is sorted by network strength. 

### TIPS AND TRICKS
- **WiFi name is not showing up on the list**
  
Make sure your Network is compatible with 2.4GHz. The Bitaxe is not available with any other WiFi types, including 5Ghz


## Network Password
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b440cd91-60ac-4024-918f-d9230dde43cb)
On this screen, type your password for your network. The Device will connect, and verify a connection before moving on to the next screen.

### TIPS AND TRICKS
- **WiFi Name Show up in the list, but won't connect**
  Check your password for errors. Make sure there are no Spaces at the beginning or end of the password. Check  for commonly replaced characters (0 vs O, 5 vs S, etc.)
  If this still doesn't connect, make sure your Bitaxe is not too far away from your WiFi access point, and free from obstructions and interference.
  
# **_SETUP MINING POOL_**
## Public-Pool.io QuickStart Guide

Out of the box, the Bitaxe Touch UI provides easu setup to public-pool.io. All you need to know is your BTC Payout Address.

### TIPS AND TRICKS
- **BTC Adress Does not verify**
  Check your address for errors. Make sure there are no Spaces at the beginning or end of the address. Check for commonly replaced characters (0 vs O, 5 vs S, etc.)
  If this still doesn't connect, make sure your Bitaxe is not too far away from your WiFi access point, and free from obstructions and interference.
  If your Internet connection is unstable, the Bitaxe will fail to receive the required response from the API server to verify the address is a valid Bitcoin Address.

# **_WEB UI SETUP_**
Advanced Setup can still be completed on the webUI by connecting to the Bitaxe IP Address. **NOTE** This is a different IP than the one used for setting up the BTC Payout Address. The Bitaxe IP can be found on the "Activity" Screen
